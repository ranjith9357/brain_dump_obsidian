Welcome to my Documentation Hub! Feel free to have a look around.

Knowledge is a resource that multiplies when shared, not diminishes.

This repo is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault and best viewed with Obsidian. You can still directly browse the markdown files here, but you may be missing niceties that Obsidian provides.

### 📌 Good Note-Taking Practices

1. **Link Your Thoughts** – Connect ideas across notes to form a web of knowledge.  
2. **Use Maps of Content (MOCs)** – Create index notes that organize topics hierarchically.  
3. **Tag and Categorize** – Make notes easier to search and discover later.  
4. **Keep Notes Atomic** – Each note should contain one idea or concept for clarity.  
5. **Review and Update Regularly** – Knowledge grows when you revisit and refine notes.
