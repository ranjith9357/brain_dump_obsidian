<span style="color:#4DB6AC; font-size:2em;">What is an Exocortex?</span>

An exocortex is a collection of notes. A note is a container of thoughts that has meaning for the person who made it.

At their best, notes are treasures that we leave behind for our future selves and future generations. At their worst, notes are an overwhelming disorganized collection of thoughts that are never read.

### 📌 Good Note-Taking Practices

1. **Link Your Thoughts** – Connect ideas across notes to form a web of knowledge.  
2. **Use Maps of Content (MOCs)** – Create index notes that organize topics hierarchically.  
3. **Tag and Categorize** – Make notes easier to search and discover later.  
4. **Keep Notes Atomic** – Each note should contain one idea or concept for clarity.  
5. **Review and Update Regularly** – Knowledge grows when you revisit and refine notes.
