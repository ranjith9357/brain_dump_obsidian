Docker was **developed by Solomon Hykes** and the team at **dotCloud**, a platform-as-a-service company. It was **first released in March 2013** as an open-source project.

Fun fact: Docker popularized **containerization** in a way that made it very accessible, even though the underlying container technology (like LXC) existed before.

- Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in **containers**.
- Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments.
- Benefits:
  - Consistency across environments
  - Lightweight virtualization
  - Easy deployment
  - Fast startup
